# Contributing to the ES pipe operatorâ€™s proposal
First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Here are some suggestions to contributing to this proposal.
The pipe operator in JavaScript has a [long and twisty history][HISTORY.md].
A lot of issues have already been argued round in round in circles.

Bearing that in mind:

1. Please read [HISTORY.md][]. This will give a lot of context
   behind whatâ€™s been happening to the proposal since its creation in 2017.
2. Please read the [TC39 Code of Conduct][CoC].
   It has important information about how weâ€™re all expected to act
   and what to do when we feel like someone is not meeting the Code.
   We all want to maintain a friendly, productive working environment!
3. Please read the [TC39 How to Give Feedback][feedback] article.
4. Please read the [proposal explainer][] to make sure that it is
   not already addressed there.
4. If the explainer does not already explain your topic adequately,
   then please [search the repository issues][issues]
   to see if any issues match the topic you had in mind.
   This proposal is more than four years old,
   and it is likely that the topic has already been raised and thoroughly discussed.
5. Try to keep any existing issues on their original topic.
6. If you feel that someone is not meeting the [TC39 Code of Conduct][CoC],
   then please follow its directions for reporting the violation,
   including emailing [tc39-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com][].

Thank you again for taking the time to contribute!
